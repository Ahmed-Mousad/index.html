          <h3>Definitions:</h3>
          <p>
            The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a system of interrelated, internet-connected objects that are able to collect and transfer data over a wireless network without human intervention.
            The personal or business possibilities are endless. A ‘thing’ can refer to a connected medical device, a biochip transponder (think livestock), a solar panel, a connected automobile with sensors that alert the driver to a myriad of possible issues (fuel, tire pressure, needed maintenance, and more) or any object, outfitted with sensors, that has the ability to gather and transfer data over a network.

      <h3>Politics and civic engagement:</h3>
      <p>
        Some scholars and activists argue that the IoT can be used to create new models of civic engagement if device networks can be open to user control and inter-operable platforms. Philip N. Howard, a professor and author, writes that political life in both democracies and authoritarian regimes will be shaped by the way the IoT will be used for civic engagement. For that to happen, he argues that any connected device should be able to divulge a list of the "ultimate beneficiaries" of its sensor data and that individual citizens should be able to add new organisations to the beneficiary list. In addition, he argues that civil society groups need to start developing their IoT strategy for making use of data and engaging with the public.
